# Activation functions and their performance conditioned on dimensions of data

As part of the class project for Machine Learning II @Frankfurt School, we dive deeper into undertanding Activation Functions used in Neural Networks.

1)	Activation functions in neural networks 

a.	Compare different options in terms of simplicity, efficiency and performance and see if there are any patterns

b.	Check performance depending on the dimension of the dataset or the type of data
